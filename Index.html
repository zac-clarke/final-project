                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zac Clarke was born in Pointe Claire, Quebec. Growing up they enjoyed mathematics and biking.
                    Later they enjoyed debating and leadership during their high school years at John Rennie highschool.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During college Zac studied Media arts honing their craft making videos,animations and especially photography.
                    Darkroom photography was their favorite because it produced a physical representation of a subject through physical manipulation of light through a chemical process.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After college Zac went to work, mostly kitchen work which left Zac wanting more, so they decided to study carpentry.
                    At carpentry school zac learned that carpentry was much more subjective than they had previously thought, although again creating something out of raw materials brought Zac joy.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next they decided to buy a business! Dirty Pizza a small restaurant in the heart of the plateau,
                    where Zac was able to do something else they love; interacting with strangers and trying to bring a little light into their days through good food and conversation.
                    After the Covid 19 pandemic Zac was tired of trying to keep their business afloat and decided finaly to sell their business and learn a new trade!<br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Full Stack Developer program allowed Zac to get back to their roots working in a more logical mathmatical setting,
                    honing their craft as a programmer brought a lot of joy to Zac and that is where you will find them today,
                    typing and organizing and thinking about how to make the most beautiful and functional programs they can!</bre>
